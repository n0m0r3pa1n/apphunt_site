                Welcome to AppHunt. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the "Services"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:theapphunt@yahoo.com">theapphunt@yahoo.com</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                These Terms of Use (the "Terms") are a binding contract between you and AppHunt, Inc. ("AppHunt", "we" and "us"). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don't have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Will these Terms ever change?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the theapphunt.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
                <br/>
                If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
                <br/>
                Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
            </p>

                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>What about my privacy?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                AppHunt takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current AppHunt Privacy Policy, please <a href="/#/privacy">click here</a>.
                <br/>
                The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:theapphunt@yahoo.com">theapphunt@yahoo.com</a>.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                You may be required to sign up for an account. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
                </br>
                </br>
                You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).
                </br>
                </br>
                You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
                You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You're responsible for any activity associated with your account.

                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>What are my rights in AppHunt?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the "Content") are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else's (including AppHunt's) rights.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You understand that AppHunt owns the Services. You won't modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn't mean that all the restrictions above don't apply - they do!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Do I have to grant any licenses to AppHunt or to other users?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your "User Submission". Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For all User Submissions, you hereby grant AppHunt a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an Android device as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only â€“ your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services] (each of the foregoing, a "Public User Submission"), then you grant AppHunt the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all AppHunt users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with AppHunt's business for any purpose, provided that AppHunt will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your AppHunt account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions (other than Public User Submissions, which may remain fully available)] to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from AppHunt's records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Finally, you understand and agree that AppHunt, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.

                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"), as it relates to online service providers, like AppHunt, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone's copyright. We respect others' intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers.

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Will AppHunt ever change the Services?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We're always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Does AppHunt cost anything?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The AppHunt Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>What if I want to stop using AppHunt?</b></span>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You're free to do that at any time, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:theapphunt@yahoo.com">theapphunt@yahoo.com</a>; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. AppHunt is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. AppHunt has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of AppHunt.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.
